# countdownapp

In this example, the Java code sets up a CountDownTimer that counts down from 30 seconds. The onTick method updates the text of the TextView widget in the UI with the remaining time, and the onFinish method sets the text of the TextView to "Finished" when the countdown is complete.

The XML code sets up a TextView widget with the initial text "Seconds remaining: 30".

This is just a basic example, and you can further customize the code to meet your specific needs. For example, you can add more UI elements, change the initial countdown time, or add more functionality to the onTick and onFinish methods.
